## Define the Extension:

The extension will remove all the shorts videos from the youtube platform, if a user tries to search for a shorts video then he will not be able to find it.
Even if the user goes to /shorts url then no shorts video will be displayed.
The shorts button from the side bar has also been removed.

## Research and Analysis:

The extension is very simple i just have to display none all the fields containing that shorts video and also change some styling of the page.

## Planning:

I have made something like this so it might not be a problem to do this.
